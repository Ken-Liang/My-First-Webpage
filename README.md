# Webpage

# Purpose and Description
For my first personal project, I decided to make a website using a combination of HTML, CSS, Node.js, and the Angular Framework. I wanted to create a medium where I could start off by introducing myself and letting people know a little about myself. Furthermore, I also wanted to showcase some skills I have and some places they could contact me.
